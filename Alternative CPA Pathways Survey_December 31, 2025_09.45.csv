My reasoning comes from weighing the costs and benefits of graduate school. Completing my MAcc would extend my time in school by two years, which means delaying the income I could earn as a CPA during that period. I already have four years of experience working under a CPA, so I do not anticipate major promotions tied to additional schooling. While I do not currently have employer benefits, graduate school would further postpone starting full-time work with benefits such as health, dental, and vision coverage. The alternative school sponsored health insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield Student, is available only while enrolled and is still too expensive for me.
I already know my CPA exam discipline (tax compliance and planning), so the financial opportunity cost of delaying full-time employment is significant. However, I receive Hazelwood and Chapter 35 benefits, which cover tuition and books, so cost is not a barrier. This creates a sense of pressure to attend graduate school even though, from a financial perspective, the return on investment does not justify the additional time in school for my situation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,Very Positive,"For my situation, the alternative pathway requiring fewer credit hours and an extra year of work experience is beneficial because I already have four years of experience under a CPA.

When I tried to discuss whether graduate school was the right choice under the new rules, I asked my academic advisor to review the changes before our appointment. Unfortunately, he could not provide guidance and instead referred me to a professor, which was not helpful. This highlights a gap in advising and program support.
Graduate programs could improve by:

Training advisors on the new CPA pathways so they can give informed guidance.
Offering dedicated workshops or resources comparing the financial and career impacts of each pathway.

When I apply for jobs, a lot of the time I am told that they love the experience I have, as I already do a lot of what they are asking for, but the lack of a degree in Accounting is what is always brought up.
